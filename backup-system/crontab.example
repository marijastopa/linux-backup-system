# Backup System Crontab Configuration for macOS
# 
# NOTE: On macOS, LaunchAgents are preferred over cron for scheduled tasks.
# However, cron is still available if you prefer it.
#
# To use cron instead of LaunchAgent:
# 1. Unload the LaunchAgent:
#    launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.backup.plist
#
# 2. Edit your crontab:
#    crontab -e
#
# 3. Add one of the lines below
# 4. Save and exit
#
# IMPORTANT: On macOS Catalina and later, you may need to give Terminal
# "Full Disk Access" in System Settings → Privacy & Security

# Run daily at midnight (00:00)

# Cron format explanation:
# * * * * * command
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ └─── Day of week (0-7, 0 or 7 is Sunday)
# │ │ │ └───── Month (1-12)

# Why LaunchAgent is better on macOS:
# - Better error handling and logging
# - Survives system updates better
# - Integrates with macOS power management
# - Can catch missed runs if Mac was asleep
# - Better for battery-powered devices
#
# Use cron if:
# - You're more comfortable with it
# - You need precise timing control
# - You're using it on a server that's always on
